# Scaling Considerations

## Volume Scaling

- Queue-based posting
- Per-day and per-target limits
- Batched generation with review throttling

---

## Multi-Brand Support

- Versioned brand contexts
- Per-brand validators
- Isolated posting credentials

---

## Smarter Targeting

- Replace rules with classifiers
- Add lightweight embeddings
- Human-tuned filters

---

## Multi-Platform Posting

- Platform-specific clients
- Unified posting interface
- Per-platform safeguards

---

## Governance & Auditability

- Immutable review logs
- Comment version history
- Approval attribution
- Exportable audit trails

---

## Long-Term Vision

This system can evolve into a governed engagement platform,
but only if safety and control remain first-class concerns.
